# VR Gesture Detection Examples

## Overview

The VR Gesture Detection System comes with several example scenes to demonstrate various uses of gesture detection. These scenes are located in the `VRGestureDetection/Examples/Scenes` folder. Additionally, the `Examples` folder includes Blender files, models, materials, and textures used in the scenes.

## Example Scenes

### FightingTest

In the `FightingTest` scene, the player performs various movements to spawn items like javelins, bows, and arrows, as well as ground surges. This scene demonstrates how gestures can be used to dynamically generate items and effects in a combat scenario.

### Fishing

The `Fishing` scene allows the player to spawn and cast a fishing line by performing the corresponding movement. This scene showcases how gesture detection can be applied to simulate realistic actions like casting a fishing line in a VR environment.

### PaddleBoard

In the `PaddleBoard` scene, the player performs paddleboard strokes to move a paddleboard around. This scene illustrates how gesture detection can be utilized for locomotion and movement in a VR setting, simulating the experience of paddleboarding.  The player cannot cheat and exploit another way to move the paddle - they must perform the movement!

### SimpleTest

The `SimpleTest` scene is a basic demonstration where gestures are displayed in a text list as the player performs them. This scene is useful for testing and validating gesture recognition, providing a simple interface to observe detected gestures.

### SpawnItems

In the `SpawnItems` scene, the player performs throw movements to spawn bouncy balls. This scene demonstrates how gestures can be used to create and interact with objects in a playful VR environment.

## Examples Folder Structure

- `Blendfiles`: Contains the `.blend` Blender files used to create the models for the scenes.
- `Fbx`: Includes the `.fbx` models used in the scenes.
- `Materials`: Holds the materials applied to the models in the scenes.
- `Textures`: Contains the textures used for the materials in the scenes.
- `Scenes`: The folder where all the example Unity scenes are located.

## Getting Started with the Examples

1. **Open the Example Scene**
   - Navigate to `VRGestureDetection/Examples/Scenes` in the Unity Project window.
   - Double-click on the desired scene to open it.

2. **Play the Scene**
   - Enter Play mode by clicking the Play button in the Unity Editor.
   - Perform the gestures described for each scene to see the gesture detection system in action.

3. **Modify and Experiment**
   - Feel free to modify the scenes, add new gestures, or change the existing ones to better understand how the VR Gesture Detection System can be integrated into your own projects.
