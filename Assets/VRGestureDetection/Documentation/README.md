# VR Gesture Detection System

## Overview

The VR Gesture Detection System is designed to provide a robust solution for detecting and responding to user gestures in VR environments. Leveraging Unity, Barracuda, and other advanced technologies, this system offers seamless integration with VR projects, enabling developers to create immersive and interactive experiences.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Gesture Detection**: High accuracy and low latency detection of user gestures.
- **Multi-Gesture Support**: Recognizes and processes multiple gestures simultaneously.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup and configuration within Unity.
- **Configurable Events**: Easily configure and respond to gesture events.

## Examples

### Basic Gesture Detection

```csharp
void Start()
{
    GestureDetection.Instance.AddGestureEvent(new GestureEvent
    {
        gestureName = "waving right hand",
        onGestureDetected = new UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent()
    });

    GestureDetection.Instance.AddGestureEvent(new GestureEvent
    {
        gestureName = "waving left hand",
        onGestureDetected = new UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent()
    });

    GestureDetection.Instance.GetGestureEvents()[0].onGestureDetected.AddListener(OnWaveDetected);
    GestureDetection.Instance.GetGestureEvents()[1].onGestureDetected.AddListener(OnWaveDetected);
}

void OnWaveDetected()
{
    Debug.Log("Wave gesture detected!");
}
```
